      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a results-driven Data Analyst with 5+ years of experience working across Healthcare and Financial domains, helping organizations turn complex data into clear, actionable insights. I currently support enterprise analytics initiatives at Tenet Healthcare, where I work on large-scale clinical and operational datasets to improve reporting, data quality, and decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work spans data analysis, ETL development, and business intelligence, with hands-on experience building end-to-end analytics solutions using SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and cloud platforms. I specialize in transforming raw, high-volume data into meaningful dashboards, performance metrics, and executive-ready reports that support both clinical and financial stakeholders.
